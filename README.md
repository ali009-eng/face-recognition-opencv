# Face Recognition with OpenCV (No Deep Learning)

This project implements face detection and recognition using **only OpenCV** and the **LBPH algorithm**. It's a lightweight, offline, and fast system â€” perfect for learning the basics of computer vision.

## Features

- Real-time face detection with Haar Cascades
- Face recognition using LBPH
- Webcam-based dataset builder
- Easy training and recognition scripts
- No deep learning or external ML frameworks needed

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
